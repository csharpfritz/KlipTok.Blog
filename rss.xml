    <title>Artificial Intelligence and Mature Content</title>
    <link>https://kliptok.com/blog/posts/posts/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Mature-Content.html</link>
    <description><p>In the time since KlipTok launched in November 2020, our intent with the content presented is that it would closely mirror the content of Twitch, its parent platform. It's been great to see that the popular games and content from Twitch appear in a similar pattern of growth and waning on KlipTok. To that end, we've seen some content appear that various communities around the world would consider racy.</p>
<p>We want to focus on improving the experience for the casual visitors to KlipTok.  We define 'casual visitors' as folks who browse to the website without logging in.  The casual visitor browses the site and does not want KlipTok to interact with their Twitch account or save preferences for interacting with the site.</p>
<p>One of the features requested for some time on the <a href="https://feedback.kliptok.com/posts/47/mature-flag">KlipTok feedback site has been a 'mature flag'</a> that identifies content that could be considered risqu√© or racy that some folks would like to avoid. In this post, we're going to introduce a new 'racy' safety warning on KlipTok and discuss the feedback that went into the feature as well as introduce the next round of features to support this type of community standards enforcement.</p></description>

    <description><p>We hit two large data milestones this month, 16 million clips indexed and more than 2 million channels are now known by KlipTok.  It's a huge step in the growth of the application, and we want to thank all of our supporters for helping spread the word about KlipTok.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of work, we're delivering two heavily requests sets of pages and content to KlipTok: Categories and Teams.</p></description>

    <title>Pin Channels and Performance Updates</title>
    <link>https://kliptok.com/blog/posts/posts/7-PinChannels.html</link>
    <description><p>The &quot;secret sauce&quot; of KlipTok has been that it is a service for streamers, written by a streamer, live on stream. This week, we added a new wrinkle to that mix.  We added a feauture requested by viewers, designed by viewers.</p></description>

    <title>Introducing Channel Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://kliptok.com/blog/posts/posts/6-IntroducingChannelSuggestions.html</link>
    <description><p>Our team that's been working on KlipTok has no experience with building machine learning algorithms.  With some advice from friends on the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet">ML.NET</a> project team, they got us pointed to a few demos that would allow us to start using the power of machine learning to make more interesting interactions with KlipTok.</p>
<p><img src="img/601-MachineLearningGeneratedSuggestedStreamers.png" alt="The new suggested streamers panel on KlipTok, generated using ML.NET" /></p>
<p>ML.NET makes it easy for .NET developers to build, manage, and consume machine-learning models.  We believe can unlock some interesting insights from the KlipTok data using this framework.</p>
<p>In particular, we went through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/movie-recommendation">&quot;Movie Recommendation&quot; tutorial</a> and immediately identified some changes that we could implement in KlipTok.  In particular, let's use a similar technique to suggest channels based on the channels you already follow on Twitch.</p>
<p>Let me explain how we use ML.NET to recommend channels for KlipTok.</p></description>

    <link>https://kliptok.com/blog/posts/posts/3-IntroducingCategoriesAndContentSafety.html</link>
    <description><p>This week we are happy to announce the release of Version 0.23 with a number of small fixes, updated translations, a new translation for Slovenian, and a new feature: IAB Categories and Content Safety tags for transcribed clips.  I'm definitely burying the lede here, but I think it's worth it to give you a quick summary of what's new.</p></description>

    <title>Most Requested Feature Deployed - Live Now on Twitch</title>
    <link>https://kliptok.com/blog/posts/posts/2-IntroducingLiveIndicators.html</link>
    <description><p>Over the last few months, the most requested feature on KlipTok on the <a href="https://feedback.kliptok.com">feedback site</a> has been the addition of a &quot;Live Now&quot; indicator for the list of channels.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><a href="https://feedback.kliptok.com/posts/23/live-now-icon-next-to-the-channels-name-in-the-list-of-streamers"><img src="img/feedback-LiveIndicator.png" alt="Screenshot from feedback.kliptok.com - Request to add a 'Live' indicator next to channels" /></a></p>
<p><span aria-label="caption" class="caption">Original feedback requesting the Live Indicator</span></p>
</div>
<p>On Twitch, its a simple red circle.. the circle doesn't really tell you anything, and you need to hover over it in order to see what it actually means.  On KlipTok, we want to be more inclusive and support folks that have different web usage capabilities.</p>
<p>Our 'Live Now' indicator is a red rounded square with the word 'LIVE' in the middle.  It's easy to spot and clear what it's referring to.  If you click on it, you'll be taken to their channel in a new tab of your browser.</p>
<p>You can even use the sidebar refresh buttons, the spinning arrows next to the titles in the sidebar, to refresh the list of current channels that KlipTok has for you and it will update the Live status appropriately as well.</p>
