This is our first post on the KlipTok blog, and I'm thrilled to have this live for folks to learn more about howKlipTok is built and to allow us to announce new features as well as milestones reached.  I'll have a few more posts today and later this week talking about what KlipTok is, how it was built, and how you can participate.

At the end of July 2021, we're about 8 months into the evolution of the site and we're hosting about 680 channels clips.  There are more than 3.1 million clips that KlipTok has indexed and has available for you to discover.

I'll write a handful of posts to get things started here to describe some of the direction behind the site, the tenets we follow as development progresses, and the Azure-based architecture used.

We hope to separate the Blazor application into its own repository and release the UI as an open source project before the end of July 2021.

Finally, we've added an amazing feature with the help of the folks at [https://assemblyai.com](Assembly AI) to provide transcription for clips.  This means you can search for clips based on what was SAID in the clip, not just the title of the clip.
