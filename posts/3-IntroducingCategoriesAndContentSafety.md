This week we are happy to announce the release of Version 0.23 with a number of small fixes, updated translations, a new translation for Slovenian, and a new feature: IAB Categories and Content Safety tags for transcribed clips.  I'm definitely burying the lede here, but I think it's worth it to give you a quick summary of what's new.

## IAB Categories and Content Safety

With our partners at [Assembly AI](https://assemblyai.com), we've introduced IAB Categories and Content Safety tags to clips.  You'll recall that we added clip transcriptions to KlipTok in July and made those transcriptions available to search.  We're the only website on the internet where you can search for videos based on the dialogue in the video.

The [Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)](https://www.iab.com) has a set of categories that you can use to categorize your videos.  They're a great way to make sure that your videos are appropriate for children and young people.  A [full list of categories](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/video-ad-categories/) is available online.  We've added the categories to KlipTok and you can see them tagged on clips that have been transcribed.

AssemblyAI provides a feature to detect the IAB Categories of your videos based on their transcript.  These categories can be VERY accurate... and sometimes a little funny in what they are guessing your clips are about.  KlipTok is only going to show the first 4 categories with more than 60% confidence that it thinks your video falls into.
